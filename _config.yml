# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  짤막한, 아니면 기억하고 싶은 잡스런 코드나 약간의 주절거림이 있는 개인 블로그입니다. 장고 기반의 블로그에서 옮겨왔어요. 저는 이런 백엔드 없는 정적 사이트에 완전히 만족해요. 심지어 더 빠르군요! This github page is Rockheung's studying and playing blog moved from django-zinnia based blog. I'm fully satisfied these 'No-Backend-Static-Web-Site' things. Even faster!
